# WeTube

## Introduction

School project where we have to create a Youtube/Netflix-like video streaming platform with JavaEE.

We have to ask the user if he wants to allow the platform to mine crypto-currencies on his browser. If the user accepts,
then he gets some more features.

This is not meant to be used as a real service though.

## Requirements

- **Tomcat 9**: can not use Tomcat 10 because Hibernate 5 with HikariCP does not work with Jakarta (or I don't know how
  to make it work), and we didn't want to use Hibernate 6 Beta
- **Java 17**: can probably still work with Java 8 or 11, though we have not tested with these versions ðŸ¤·
